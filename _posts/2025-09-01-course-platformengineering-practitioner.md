Starting September 2, I will be joining a 5-week live course to sharpen my skills in platform engineering. It's run by <a href="https://university.platformengineering.org/platform-engineering-certified-practitioner" target="_blanc">Platform Engineering University</a> and focuses on building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) using proven frameworks and tools.

This isn't a passive video course. It's hands-on, with live sessions, homework, and real-world tasks. The goal is to learn how to design and build platforms that developers actually want to use.

## This course covers

- Core concepts of platform engineering
- How platform engineering differs from DevOps and SRE
- Building IDPs from scratch
- Choosing the right tools and architecture
- Designing golden paths for developers
- Creating useful abstractions
- Infrastructure platform engineering
- Building and selling a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)
- There’s also a certification at the end, which helps show you understand the full scope of platform engineering—not just bits and pieces.

I am looking forward to applying what I learn to my work and future contracts. This course should help me design systems that scale and stay engineer and developer-friendly.
