September 2, I started to join a 5-week live course to sharpen my skills in platform engineering. It's provided by <a href="https://university.platformengineering.org/platform-engineering-certified-practitioner" target="_blanc">Platform Engineering University</a> and focuses on building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) using proven frameworks and tools. This isn't a passive video course. It's hands-on, with live sessions, homework, and real-world tasks. The goal is to learn how to design and build platforms that developers actually want to use.

- Intro to platform engineering
- How to build an Internal Developer Platform
- Platform tooling 101
- The art of building golden paths
- Designing golden paths for developers
- Finding the right abstraction(s)
- Infrastructure platform engineering
- How to build your Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)
- How to sell your MVP to key stakeholders

There's also a certification at the end, which helps show you understand the full scope of platform engineering, not just bits and pieces.

I am looking forward to applying what I learn to my work and future contracts. This course should help me design systems that scale and stay engineer and developer-friendly.
