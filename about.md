My name is Martin Swinkels, I was born in the Netherlands and lived in Switzerland for a couple of years, and just moved to Portugal.

I am a cloud developer with over 20 years of experience in developing customer tailored solutions on Microsoft platforms. I am a team player specialized in designing and building solutions on Azure, Azure DevOps, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Power Platform, focused on process automation and productivity for business and development teams. I am eager to learn, share and collaborate on new technologies to continuously improve.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Currently, I am expanding my field of expertise with Azure RM and Terraform to develop and deploy IaC for VMs and AVDs in a multi-tenant environment.</p>

In my spare time I like to travel and discover new places with my wife on our motorcycle or e-bikes. Coffee keeps me sharp and I am always up for a nice dinner, especially when it is home cooked by my lovely wife. Furthermore, I like to stay fit by working out in the gym or by taking a firm walk.
