My name is Martin Swinkels, born in the Netherlands, lived in Switzerland for 8 years and currently living in Portugal.

I am a cloud developer with over 20 years of experience in developing customer tailored solutions on Microsoft platforms. I am a team player specialized in designing and building solutions on Azure, Azure DevOps, and the Microsoft Power Platform, focused on process automation and productivity. I am eager to learn, share and collaborate on new technologies to continuously improve. 

In my spare time I like to travel and discover new places with my wife on our e-bikes. Coffee keeps me sharp and I am always up for a nice dinner, especially when it is home cooked by my lovely wife.
