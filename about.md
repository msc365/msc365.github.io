Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Martin and I was born in the Netherlands, lived in Switzerland for almost 10 years, and moved to Portugal in 2023.

I am a Microsoft specialist with over 20 years of experience in developing customer tailored solutions on Microsoft platforms. I am specialized in designing and building solutions on Azure, Azure DevOps, and Microsoft Power Platform, focused on process automation and productivity for business and development teams.

In my spare time I like to travel and explore new places together with my wife on our motorcycles and e-bikes. Coffee keeps me sharp and I like to stay fit by working out or by taking a hike along the beautiful beaches of the Algarve.
