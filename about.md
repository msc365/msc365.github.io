Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Martin. I was born in the Netherlands, spent nearly a decade living in Switzerland, and relocated to Portugal in 2023.

I am a Microsoft specialist with over 24 years of experience in crafting customized solutions on Microsoft platforms. My expertise lies in designing and (re)building solutions on Azure, Azure DevOps, and Microsoft Power Platform. I focus on process automation, enhancing productivity, and supporting business, development, and platform teams.

I have a deep passion for writing code and take great joy in helping others who want to learn. Whether itâ€™s mentoring new developers or sharing insights on best practices, I believe in the power of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

In my free time, I love traveling and discovering new destinations with our camper, which also serves as a home office when needed. Coffee is my go-to for staying sharp, and I maintain my fitness by hitting the gym regularly. My wife and I also enjoy hiking along the stunning beaches of the Algarve. Additionally, we share a passion for motorcycling and mountain-biking.
