## Third-party resources

- [Jekyll Tags on Github Pages](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) by Long Qian  
  An awesome and clear article about implementing tags to your yekyll site on GitHub Pages. I used the same methodology to add categories to my site and did some cool adjustments with category style to distinguish them from tags. And they even work with **light** and **dark** skin modes.
