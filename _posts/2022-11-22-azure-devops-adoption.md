**Implementing a DevOps environment leaves a lot to juggle, so you should aim to provide a first class implementation and adoption through clear communication and expectations.**

For a customer project I implemented an Azure DevOps environment containing documentation and samples to demonstrate different usage patterns for Azure DevOps projects. Together with the adoption team, I promoted a lot of contributions to the project and onboarded over 60 new users. Members soon started to feel comfortable using DevOps and started to see all the benefits.

### Why do you need a DevOps transformation?

Watch this video with your team and get inspired, it will save you a lot of time to explain and convince everyone.

### This didn’t convince you?

Try to uncover better ways of developing software with Agile.  

- [The Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/)
- [12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/)

### I have a small company, isn’t this too complicated?

It’s easy to set up, you’ll be up and running in minutes, then you’ll improve your process step-by-step, each iteration. You just need to start…

### I don’t develop software, I’m more into infrastructure

Maybe you could take a look at these topics?

- [Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)
- [Continuous Delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-continuous-delivery)

Okay, I understand that you have some questions left.

Please contact me, I’m here to hear your ideas so I can help you to implement or improve your DevOps experience.
