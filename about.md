Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Martin.  

I am a Microsoft specialist with over 25 years of experience in crafting customized solutions on Microsoft platforms. My expertise lies in designing, building, and improving solutions on SharePoint and Microsoft 365. Since 2020, I have expanded my skill set to include developing solutions on Azure, Azure DevOps, and Microsoft Power Platform. I focus on process automation and enhancing productivity while supporting business, development, and platform teams.

I have a deep passion for writing code in .NET and PowerShell, and I take great joy in creating low-code business apps using the Power Platform. I like helping others who want to learn and grow. Whether itâ€™s mentoring or sharing insights on best practices, I believe in the power of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

I was born in the Netherlands, spent nearly a decade living in Switzerland, and relocated to Portugal in 2023 where I started as a remote freelancer.

In my free time, I love traveling and discovering new destinations with our camper, which also serves as a home office when needed. Coffee is my go-to for staying sharp, and I maintain my fitness by hitting the gym regularly. My wife and I also enjoy hiking along the stunning beaches of the Algarve. Additionally, we share a passion for motorcycling and mountain-biking.
