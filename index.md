> **Note**: As of February 2023 I will start as a remote (hybrid) freelancer, based in Portugal, offering my services throughout Europe, mainly Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland. In the meantime I am building this blog, first to showcase my portfolio and then to write about common use cases I come across.
