I'm excited to announce that I have secured my first assignment as a freelancer! Together with the Architecture & Development team, we will be transforming the organization's way of working by implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Bicep. This collaborative effort will replace their current PowerShell-based method for deploying resources to Azure, fostering teamwork and shared success.

### Deliverables

- **Simplified Syntax**  
  Deliver a more concise and readable syntax with Bicep, replacing the often verbose and complex scripts in PowerShell.

- **Modularity**  
  Provide modular templates through Bicep, making it easier to manage and reuse code across different projects.

- **Better Integration**  
  Ensure better integration and support for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates by using Bicep, which is designed specifically for Azure.

- **Error Handling**  
  Implement improved error handling and validation with Bicep, reducing the chances of deployment failures.

- **Tooling Support**  
  Enhance the development experience with robust tooling support, including Visual Studio Code extensions that offer features like IntelliSense and syntax highlighting.

- **Declarative Approach**  
  Adopt a declarative approach with Bicep, making it easier to understand and manage the desired state of the infrastructure without needing to write imperative scripts.

### <summary>Some more deliverables</summary>

- **Training Sessions**  
  Conduct training sessions to familiarize engineers with Bicep syntax and best practices.

- **Documentation**  
  Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to help engineers understand how to use Bicep effectively.

- **Pilot Projects**  
  Start with pilot projects to allow engineers to gain hands-on experience with Bicep in a controlled environment.

- **Mentorship**  
  Establish a mentorship program where experienced Bicep users can support and guide new adopters.

- **Feedback Loop**  
  Create a feedback loop to gather input from engineers and continuously improve the adoption process.

- **Incentives**  
  Offer incentives or recognition for engineers who successfully adopt and utilize Bicep in their projects.
