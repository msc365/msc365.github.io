Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Martin â€” a Microsoft Azure DevOps Engineer with over 25 years of experience delivering scalable, secure, and automated solutions across the Microsoft ecosystem.

Since 2020, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint into Power Platform and Azure, helping organizations modernize their platforms, streamline deployments, and adopt DevOps best practices. Iâ€™ve delivered self-service automation frameworks, ALM-compliant Power Platform solutions, and DevOps onboarding programs that empower teams and accelerate delivery.

Today I specialize in designing and implementing cloud-native architectures using Azure, Azure DevOps, GitHub and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Bicep, PowerShell, and YAML pipelines. My work focuses on enabling agile delivery, CI/CD automation, and end-to-end RBAC governance platform operations for SaaS and enterprise environments, aka Azure platform landing zones and solution/workload landing zones.

Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, automation, and helping others. Whether itâ€™s building reusable templates, coaching teams on DevOps workflows, or integrating Azure services with business applications, I bring a collaborative, results-driven mindset to every project.

I've worked remotely across The Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal since 2015. Currently I'm supporting clients across Europe as a freelance DevOps/Platform Engineer and trusted advisor.
