Implementing a DevOps environment leaves a lot to juggle, so you should aim to provide a first class implementation and adoption through clear communication and expectations.

For a customer project I've implemented an Azure DevOps way of working, containing practical samples to demonstrate different usage patterns for Azure DevOps projects. Together with an adoption team, we did a lot of promotion, and bottom-up implementations. I contributed to this project by delivering first class documentation regarding governance and guidelines, knowledge spread, and I onboarded over 60 new users. Over time, users became more comfortable using Azure DevOps and began to see benefits in the transformation to a DevOps way of working.

### Why do you need a DevOps transformation?

Watch these videos with your team and get inspired, it will save you a lot of time to explain and convince everyone separately.

It’s easy to set up, you’ll be up and running in minutes, then you’ll improve your process step-by-step, each iteration. You just need to start…

### I don’t develop software, I’m more into infrastructure
