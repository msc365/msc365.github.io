I am immensely proud to announce that a Microsoft ISV (Independent Software Vendor) in the Netherlands awarded me a hiring contract to deliver business value and share my knowledge with the internal Microsoft Azure team. I'm looking forward to collaborating with this amazing team for the next year to create meaningful Azure Multi-tenant SaaS solutions and accelerators for; Azure ISV Landing Zones and SaaS workloads like; Certificate Authority, Security Operations Center and Microsoft 365 Automation (DSC), while helping to transform into an infrastructure as code organization using Bicep, PowerShell, and Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines.

### Deliverables

- Infrastructure as Code for a Multi-tenant Azure platform and Landing Zone SaaS solutions;
- Deployment acceleration using Bicep IaC, CI/CD Pipelines and PowerShell;
- Team training and ongoing support to ensure success with DevOps practices;
- Self-serviced Azure DevOps automation for setting up new SaaS projects.
