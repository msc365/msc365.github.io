For a customer project I've implemented an Azure DevOps way of working, containing webinars and practical samples to demonstrate different usage patterns for Azure DevOps projects. Together with an adoption team, we did a lot of promotion, and bottom-up implementations. I contributed to this project by delivering first class documentation, governance and guidelines, knowledge spread, and I onboarded over 60 new users. Over time, users became more comfortable using Azure DevOps and also began to see the benefits in the transformation to a DevOps way of working.

### Why do you need a DevOps transformation?

I'm happy to help start or improve your DevOps experience. Please see what's already available online and watch these expert videos and get inspired.

### This didn't convince you?

Try to uncover better ways of developing software or infrastructure as code (IaC) with Agile.

### I have a small company, isn't this too complicated?

In short: _No it's not!_ It's easier to set up, you'll be up and running in minutes, then you'll improve your process step-by-step, each iteration. You just need to go for it.

### I don't develop software, I'm more into infrastructure

Maybe you should take a look at these topics and read more about what IaC is all about.

- [What is Infrastructure as Code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uETq8KKVUFY)  
  In this video, Abel Wang explains the concepts of IaC

- [Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Comparing the Tools](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/infrastructure-as-code-iac-comparing-the-tools/ba-p/3205045)  
  In this blog April Edwards writes about IaC and the tools that we can use and choose from.

- [Microsoft learn: Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)  
  Uses DevOps methodology and versioning with a descriptive model to define and deploy infrastructure, such as networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topologies. 

- [Microsoft learn: Continuous Delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-continuous-delivery)  
  Continuous delivery (CD) is the process of automating build, test, configuration, and deployment from a build to a production environment.
