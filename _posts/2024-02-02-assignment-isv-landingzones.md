I am immensely proud to announce that a Microsoft ISV (Independent Software Vendor) in the Netherlands awarded me a hiring contract to deliver business value and share my knowledge with the internal Microsoft Azure team.

Looking forward to collaborating with the Microsoft Azure team for the next year to create meaningful Azure Multi-tenant SaaS solutions and secure deployments with accelerators for; Azure ISV Landing Zones and SaaS workloads like; Certificate Authority, Security Operations Center and Microsoft 365 Automation (DSC). I will also support the team to transform into an infrastructure as code organization using Bicep, PowerShell, and Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines.

### Deliverables

- **Infrastructure as Code for a Multi-tenant Azure platform and Landing Zone SaaS solutions**  
  Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to efficiently manage and provision a scalable, secure, and compliant multi-tenant Azure environment. This includes setting up Landing Zones tailored for SaaS solutions to ensure optimal performance and governance.

- **Deployment acceleration using Bicep IaC, CI/CD Pipelines, and PowerShell**  
  Utilizing Bicep for IaC, along with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and PowerShell scripting, to streamline and expedite the deployment process. This approach reduces manual intervention, minimizes errors, and accelerates time-to-market.

- **Team training and ongoing support to ensure success with DevOps practices**  
  Providing comprehensive training sessions and continuous support to teams, enabling them to adopt and excel in DevOps practices. This ensures that the team is well-equipped to handle the complexities of modern development and operations workflows.

- **Self-serviced Azure DevOps automation for setting up new SaaS projects**  
  Developing automated, self-service solutions within Azure DevOps to facilitate the quick and efficient setup of new SaaS projects. This empowers teams to initiate projects independently, reducing dependency on centralized IT resources and speeding up project initiation.
